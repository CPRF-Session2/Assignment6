1. 
    Is there anything wrong with this code? If so, what is it and how would you fix it?

    #include <stdio.h> 
    int main() {
    int num, n;
    int arr[num];
    printf(“Enter the size of an array”);
    scanf(“%d”, &num);
    for (n=0; n<num; n++) {
    	arr[n] = 0;
    }		 
    }
    
    yes, the printf and scanf staments should be before the array declarion and for loop. 

    #include <stdio.h> 
    int main() {
    int num, n;
    printf(“Enter the size of an array”);
    scanf(“%d”, &num);
    int arr[num];
    for (n=0; n<num; n++) {
    	arr[n] = 0;
    }		 
    }

    2. A segmention fault is when the program tries to access memory that it isn't allowed to. For example, if you tried to access arr[1000] if arr was size 10. 

    3. An enum assigns names to a set of constants/integers. A struct is a collection of variables of different types. A struct is used to store information, while an enum us used to make the code easier to read.

    4. yes the code would be:
    	struct strct {
		int enum dwarfs { dwarf0, dwarf1...};
		}
