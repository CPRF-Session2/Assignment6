1. 
The following code is correct execpt for the fact that the int arr[num] should be on the line after the user inputs the number num is going to be. There should also be a return 0; at the end of main.


2.
A segmentation fault is when a program tries to access a memory location that it can't access.

For example, let's say use you use scanf to read a user input number. However, you don't use the & sign to store the number in memory. This will give you a segmentation fault.

3. A struct is a collection of variables with different basic data types that are under one name. An enum defines a set of named integer constants that start at 0 and increment by 1 for each value.


4. You can include a enums within a struct. 
As an example:

struct holiday{

enum holiday {christmas, easter, halloween} day;
};

int main
{
struct holiday h;

h.day= halloween;

return 0;
}
