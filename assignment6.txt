/*Rebecca Hale Assignment 6 Part 2*/
1.  There are problems with the code.  First, num is not given a value 
before it is assigned as arr's size, which will result in unexpected 
outputs. While num is eventually given a value, this value does not
transfer over to the size of arr, which could result in unexpected 
outputs.  Also, 0 is never returned in the main.

2. A segmentation fault is a runtime error that occurs when the computer
attempts to access memory that it is not supposed to access for the specific
function or when the computer tries to access memory that was not allocated
for whatever program it was trying to run.

3. A struct in C allows variables of different data types to be linked 
together into a single formation.  On the other hand, enumerated lists 
(enums) are just lists of symbolic constants and do not contain data 
types in their lists, they are organized by integers.  

4. An enum can be used within a struct. For example...

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef enum {red,white} color;
typedef struct {
	char name[100];
	color c;
} Flower;

int main(){
	Flower daisy;
	strcpy(daisy.name, "DAISY");
	daisy.c = white;
	return 0;
}
