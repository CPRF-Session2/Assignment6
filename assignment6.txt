1)	The int arr[num]; should go after the user inputs a value for num.

1)	(yep; 2 questions called "1") A segmentation fault occurs when the program attempts to access an area of memory it doesn't have access to, such as trying to get arr[5] of an array of a size less than 6.

2)	An enum is a numbered list, while a struct is a set of values grouped together without numbering.

3)	Yes;

	struct nums
	{
		float f1;
		float f2;
		enum ints;
	}

	struct nums n;
	n.f1 = 0.5;
	n.f2 = 1.3;
	enum ints
	{
		zero,
		one,
		two,
		three
	};
