In a text file `assignment6.txt`, answer the following questions:

1.  Is there anything wrong with this code? If so, what is it and how would you fix it?
  
``` 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() {
  int num, n;
  int arr[num];
  printf(“Enter the size of an array”); 
  scanf(“%d”, &num);
  for (n=0; n<num; n++) {
    arr[n] = 0;
  }
}

```
	The input of num has to be before its usage in the size of arr.


2. In your own words, what is a segmentation fault? Give an example. 
	A segmentation fault is when your program has tried to access a section of memory which it is not allowed to access.

3. Explain the difference between an enum and a struct.
	An enum basically gives a list of variables a value from 0. (values can be explicitly set however). A struct on the otherhand creates a type of data that contains several variables inside.

4. Can you include an enum within a struct? If so, how would you go about this?
	You would be able to if you set the enum to have a global scope and then use the enum as normal. (I think)
